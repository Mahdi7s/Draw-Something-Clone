Draw something clone is an excellent social drawing app that I developed using Android-Studio, Java, ParseServer, and Javascript.

- You can create a guessing drawing photo with three given words (or your own words)
- You can solve a random public puzzle or your selected friends

### Game features
- Progressive leagues as you level up
- Public share of your created puzzle for all players
- Complete painting editor to draw
- Different difficulty levels with increasing rewards
- Player profile (name, link, score, solved and created puzzles)
- Word guessing activity with shop and monetization dialog
- Achievements activity

It's about 7+ years after the game success story, so I decided to open-source it as a reference for others.
