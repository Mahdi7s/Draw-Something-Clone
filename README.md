Draw something clone is an excellent social drawing app that I developed using Android-Studio, Java, ParseServer and Javascript.
### Game features
- Progressive leagues as you level up
- Public share of your created puzzle for all players
- Create a guessing drawing photo with three given words (or your own words) with different difficulty levels and reward
- Complete painting editor to draw
- Player profile (name, link, score, solved and created puzzles)
- Solve from a random public puzzle or your selected friends
- Guessing the word activity with monetization implemented achievements

It's about 7+ years after the game success story, so I decided to open-source it as a reference for others.
